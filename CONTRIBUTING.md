# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

You are invited to report bugs or propose new features by creating an [issue](https://github.com/terminationshock/lisst/issues/new). If it is a bug, please try to boil it down to a simple reproducer that runs on any system.

Code contributions are currently not requested, but will be reviewed if they significantly improve the application. Before spending much time on improving or extending the code, please contact me first. Thank you!
